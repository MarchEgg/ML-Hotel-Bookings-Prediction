This is a older project done by me in June of 2023

# ML-Hotel-Bookings-Prediction
The goal of this project is to build a machine-learning model that can predict booking cancellations based on various attributes of reservations. This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things.
